#  :bento: Island Cuisine
Island Cuisine is a Recipe App that allows users to explore different cuisine from several islands worldwide. This project aims to showcase my skills in Ruby on Rails.

## :page_facing_up: Overview
This simple application lets users view a library of recipes, sign up for an account, favorite a recipe, and leave comments. This was accomplished using Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Material UI, and React. In the future, I hope to allow users to search through recipes and add categories.
